# moonEye
A tiny screen showing the current phase of the moon.
moon.ino Runs on an ESP8266 compatible device (in my case a WEMOS D1 Mini)
moon.py should run on anything that is connected to the internet.. (tested on linux on a raspberry Pi)


Sorry about lacking documentation of the hardware.. I'll try harder next time...
